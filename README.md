# Technical Skills Survey Project - Part 1: Digital CV Styling

---

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the first part of the Technical Skills Survey Project! This exercise, "Adding Styles to Your Digital CV," focuses on transforming a foundational HTML structure into a visually appealing and professionally branded online resume. Just as the content of a CV showcases skills and experience, its design communicates professionalism and attention to detail. This project leverages the power of **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** to bring life, color, and a unique identity to the web.

This document outlines the objectives, requirements, and the aesthetic choices made in styling the digital CV.

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this exercise was to elevate the digital CV from a mere structural document to a dynamic and engaging personal brand statement. This involved:

* **Applying CSS Styling:** Infusing the HTML structure with a comprehensive set of CSS rules.
* **Visual Branding:** Focusing on a consistent color palette, legible font choices, and a clear visual hierarchy through varying font sizes.
* **Enhancing Readability & User Experience:** Ensuring the design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and easy to navigate for visitors.

## üìã Requirements Fulfilled

This project meticulously addresses the following requirements:

* **External Styles Integration:** All styling is managed within an external `style.css` file, properly linked in the HTML's `<head>` section for clean separation of concerns and efficient management.
* **Utilizing Colors:**
    * A cohesive color palette has been implemented, complementing the overall professional theme.
    * Strong contrast between text and background colors ensures optimal readability.
    * Link colors are subtly differentiated from regular text, providing clear visual cues for interactive elements.
* **Styling Texts:**
    * The default underline on anchor (`<a>`) tags has been removed for a cleaner aesthetic.
    * Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) are emphasized through strategic use of `text-align`, `text-transform`, and other properties to establish a clear hierarchy.
    * Text shadows have been applied selectively to provide depth and prominence to key textual elements, enhancing their visual impact.
* **Selecting the Font Family:**
    * A carefully chosen typeface (`Inter`) is used, aligning with a modern and professional theme while ensuring excellent legibility.
    * A fallback font (`sans-serif`) is specified to guarantee consistent rendering across different user environments.
* **Selecting the Font Size:**
    * A clear visual hierarchy is established through varying font sizes. Headings are distinctly larger than body text, and different heading levels are easily distinguishable based on their importance.
* **Using Comments:**
    * The `style.css` file is extensively commented to clarify the purpose of specific styles, provide context, and facilitate future maintenance or collaboration.

## ‚ú® Design Choices & Highlights

In addition to meeting the core requirements, specific design choices were made to enhance the digital CV's appeal:

* **Clean Layout:** A responsive layout ensures the CV is presentable and readable across various devices.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle hover effects on links and interactive elements provide visual feedback to the user, improving the overall experience.
* **Data Visualization Integration:** (Assuming you have a Chart.js implementation for skills) The project integrates a visually appealing chart (e.g., a pie chart for skills distribution) using Chart.js, demonstrating the ability to integrate external libraries for dynamic content.
* **Professional Aesthetic:** The overall aesthetic is clean, professional, and modern, reflecting a meticulous approach to design and attention to detail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content of the digital CV.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and visual enhancements.
* **Google Fonts:** To import the `Inter` typeface for a modern and consistent typography.
* **Chart.js (Optional, if applicable):** For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
